1.File: This Java Text Editor is a simple desktop application that allows users to create, open, edit, and save text files. It provides basic functionality similar
to a standard text editor, allowing users to perform operations like creating a new document, opening an existing file, saving changes, and exiting the application.

2.Login Application: This Java program implements a simple User Management System with a graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to create new
accounts, login with their credentials, and check the validity of their login information.

3.Messenger: This Java program implements a simple chat application using the client-server model. The application consists of two parts: the server and the client.

4.Mini-Calculator: This Java program implements a simple mini calculator GUI application using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The calculator allows the user to
perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two input values and displays the result.

5.ScrollBar Implementation: This Java program implements a simple color picker application using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). The application allows users to
choose a color by adjusting the red, green, and blue (RGB) values using scrollbars or by directly entering the RGB values in text fields. The selected color is 
displayed along with its RGB values in real-time.
